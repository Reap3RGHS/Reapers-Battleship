	* More Classes Added, Program Restructuring; Created classes
	based on identifiable objects within the game, noted the main
	player and enemy characters, item shop, weapons and armor,
	potions, miscellaneous items, inventory containing items
	possessed by characters and shops.

	A game class was also created to control the global procedures
	and variables.

	There are a few procedures left to be implemented, mostly within
	the Inventory and Game classes.
